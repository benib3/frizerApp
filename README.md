💈 Personal project Frizer Ben is mobile android app created in Java and backend in Node.js using Herokuapp and mySQL. 

The Idea 💡:

We are all familiar with hairdressers and their very honorable work. One of the main problems with
the hairdresser is the organization itself around customers and appointments. In order to facilitate their work, the idea of the project is
creating an android application, in this case the problem is related to one hairdresser. The application would
have the possibility for the customer to register and access the scheduling application.
The user would be able to choose the time and date of the appointment, the user service
(haircutting, shaving, etc..) and an overview of available appointments and when he can schedule an appointment. Scheduled appointment
he receives on the application in the form of a QR code, which he needs for the validity of the scheduled appointment.In the case of cancelation it can be done in one click of button and the hairderesser gets updated on it.
The hairdresser has its own dedicated panel
where he can see scheduled appointments, cancel appointments and QR code scanner to scan QR validity
the code that the customer shows at the entrance to the shop.
Hairdresser Ben also has its own section where they can
users to read interesting things about him and his work as a hairdresser-artist.


The system has the ability for:

	📌 The user (customer) registers on the system

	📌 User selects time and date and service

	📌 Appointment scheduling and cancellation

	📌 The user receives a confirmation of the scheduled appointment in the form of a QR code

	📌 Admin (Hairdresser) has access to view scheduled appointments and the ability to cancel appointments of the same name

	📌 Admin has the ability to scan the QR code for appointment validity
	
Benefists of this type of system are:

	✔️ Better organization of work
	✔️ Much easier management of your customers
	✔️ Availability anywhere
